What are at least 3 technical issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?

1. Spotify authenicating, I was having trouble effectively saving the access token so it would be able to be generated upon running the file. Once that was fixed I was able to effectively use the token to search the spotify api

2. Linking the lyris from genius to the click link on the website, i had simple problem that was i hadnt called the lyricsUrl variable in the right folder so the information wasnt going anywhere to i moved it to the correct section

3. Proper syntac in the Procfile and the requirements.txt, i fixed them by looking at examples and running the syntax over tediously
Detailed description of 2+ known problems and how you would address them if you had more time. If none exist, what additional features might you implement, and how?

1.Heroku deployment, i am not able to get heroku to display my app, even though im having successfull builds , because of my ports i believe i cant have heroku display since it uses it own ports and my app.py relies on specifed ports

2. Port dependency, however i managed to set up my app.py has a dependency to run on specied ports, speciically the local ones, if i had more time id be able ot change around my app.py to rid the dependency.

What would you do to improve your project in the future? 

I would initially create a dabatase of songs or pull my songs that displayed from a specified genre or tag from the spotify website, and then randomize those songs, instead of hard coding 3 songs in. This would allow users to geneerate more songs that the uer may not know

Explains how someone who clones the repository can set up and run your project locally (what to install, any extra files to add).

 in order to run this project locally, the user would have to go ahead and download a good amount of different library's including: Spotify, flask, base64, json, dotenev,os,random, and requests. The user would also require extra files including: a Procfile,requirements.txt, and a .gitignore for hiding sensitvie information needed to access these apis. Last but not least a css and html to style and display the pulled information

 Detailed description of 2+ technical issues and how you solved it (your process, what you searched, what resources you used)

 1. Spotify authenicating, YOUTUBE YOUTUBE YOUTUBE, this had to be by far my best resource for this project
 evrything i had trouble on, someone on youtube already madea  tortourial for! I watched 2 videos of these guys just causally linking to the api
 and authenicating, so go over it and rewatching the steps really helped me learn whst to do.

 2. Initially getting the page to load, So this one i couldnt use youtube because it was a little too specific, but overall stack overflow and googledocs of manuels is alwasy my go to, i usually search my error problem not my code, i will look for the closest 
 person to having the same issue and piece together what problems they have that we do adn dont share, from there i had to find little pieces of what i missing and need and slpw;y assembled till i had the first page pull up
