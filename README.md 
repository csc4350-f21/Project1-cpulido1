What are at least 3 technical issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?

1. Spotify authenicating, I was having trouble effectively saving the access token so it would be able to be generated upon running the file. Once that was fixed I was able to effectively use the token to search the spotify api

2. Linking the lyris from genius to the click link on the website, i had simple problem that was i hadnt called the lyricsUrl variable in the right folder so the information wasnt going anywhere to i moved it to the correct section

3.
What are known problems (still existing), if any, with your project? 

currently none

What would you do to improve your project in the future? 

I would initially create a dabatase of songs or pull my songs that displayed from a specified genre or tag from the spotify website, and then randomize those songs, instead of hard coding 3 songs in. This would allow users to geneerate more songs that the uer may not know
